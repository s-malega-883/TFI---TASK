<p>Given the recent change in the education system, due to the ongoing pandemic, many kids are behind in
    their learning curve due to school closures. To reduce this impact, Teach For India is running a large-scale
    volunteer program, attempting to get volunteers from around the country to assist with teaching in
    online classrooms.</p>
